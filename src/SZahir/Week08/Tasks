1. Array_MoveZerosToTheEnd
Write a method that can move all the zeros to last indexes of the array (Do Not Use Sort Method)
input:  {1,0,2,0,3,0,4,0};
output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]

2️⃣  Array_NuniqueIntegersThatSumUpTo
Write a function that, given an integer N (1 < N < 100), returns an array containing N unique integers that sum up to 0.
The function can return any such array. For example, given N = 4, the function could return [1, 0, -3, 2] or [-2, 1, -4, 5].
The answer [1, -1, 1, 3] would be incorrect (because value 1 occurs twice).
For N = 3 one of the possible answers is [-1,0,1]  (but there are many more correct answers).
